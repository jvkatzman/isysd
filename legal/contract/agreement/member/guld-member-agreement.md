# Guld

Guld aims to turn all data, the entire internet, and eventually all of civilization into a single hashed and versioned file system, aka the blocktree.

By agreeing on taxonomy, we will create a universal address for every person, community, technology, media, and everything else digitally recordable.

### Governance

Every record in the tree is governed by a single guld member, it's "observer."

1. All guld members are created equal, and must be judged only by the merits of their proven contributions.
2. No censorship is allowed anywhere in the blocktree.
3. Guld members have a right to freely associate.
4. Guld members have a right to privacy, including any details of their identity except PGP key and username.
5. Guld members may copyright and optionally license their original works, and all members agree to follow any such copyrights and licenses.
6. All infrastructure must be open source, and as decentralized as members can make it.
7. All records must comply with governance of all parent (i.e. higher in the tree) records, starting with this agreement, or they may become detached from the tree.
8. Any member disputes will be arbitrated by a pre-elected third member, or the first common parent.
9. Disputes at this root level are to be arbitrated by the guld.legal organization.

### Members

Members may either be of type `life` or `community`. Either way, the member must register an official PGP signing key or keyring. This is how we prove their identity to the network.

##### Community Members

Community members must follow these additional rules.

1. Each community member must keep a ledger with voting tokens (default code `XP`), with a strictly defined lifecyle.
2. Each community member must define voting rules to govern change requests to their records.
3. Each community member is responsible for issuing and redeeming `XP` tokens according to internally consistent rules, but may never have `<= 0 XP` issued.

### Membership Fees

Membership on the network is a limited commodity, with only so many names and addresses available. The following membership fees are due once, upon name registration.
